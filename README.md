# Spyglass
Add Spyglass to your PocketMine-MP server

## How to use:
Use command `/give {player} 772` (using text for item id won't work).

Or it will be in your creative inventory if you are in Creative Mode.

## Warning:

If you are getting an error right after removing the plugin from the server, a temporary solution is to remove the player's `player.dat` from the player with the spy glasses in their inventory, or better [report the issue](https://github.com/Mcbeany/Spyglass/issues).
